; two very simple procedures
(defn inc (x) (+ x 1))
(defn square (x) (* x x))

; these two are functionally identical, but defined in different ways
; both f and g should accept one numeric value
(defn fcompose (f g)
    (lambda (x) (g (f x))))
(define fcompose2
    (lambda (f g)
        (lambda (x) (g (f x)))))

; first inc, then square, result is: (5 + 1)** 2 = 36
((fcompose inc square) 5)
; first square, then inc, result is: 5**2 + 1 = 26
((fcompose square inc) 5)
; result is: 5.5**2 + 1 = 30.25 + 1 = 31.25
((fcompose square inc) 5.5)
